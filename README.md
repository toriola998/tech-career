This project is basically aimed at solving the problem of folks who wants to get into tech. 
Often times, people ask "how do I get into tech?"..."where do I get started?"

For some, they aren't even aware of the options they have; the numerous fields in tech and the varieties of 
resources that can be used to hone a skill in tech. 

This is why this project is carefully crafted to solve that problem.
